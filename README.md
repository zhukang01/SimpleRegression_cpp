Matrix class problem:1.operator* return a local obj and before return, it get desturcted? So operator= get a ptr with nothin.
2.If i make obj temp in function operator* ,when it return the result to main(),the static obj gone, not get destruced(trueï¼‰.But at the end of main(),when destructing, it still need to destruct temp.And its p has nothing.
